Adding to Courses:
    -use either the default constructor or the overloaded 
     constructor with two strings passed as the arguments
     ( COURSE ID and GRADE )
    -Further courses then can be added using the
     "addCourse" public member function with also two 
     string arguments ( COURSE ID and GRADE )
Adding to Semester:
    -use either the default constructor or the overloaded 
    -the overloaded constructor takes as arguments, a
     pointer to courses, a STRING for the term, and an int
     for the YEAR
    -add a list of courses to any Semesterwith the addCourseList
     member function
	please note: this is best used with Default constr.
	because by adding a list any present list on the
	semester will be removed
	-this was left on as a way to replace any mistaken course
	 lists which were added
    -add individual courses using the addCourse member function
     this can be used freely as it will not remove the other list
Adding to Transcript
    -overloaded constr. takes in a STRING "ID", and a pointer to a
     semester
    -from there you can add to the array more and more semesters
     using the addSemester function
    -when using the default constructor you should set the STRING
     studentID it is initialized to "" by default
Adding to TOT
    -I tested it using the default constructor
    -I was not sure about using the overloaded constructor, to get
     it to compile I had to use the '&' and Professor Hescott said 
     it is not recommended that we use this
    -instead I just individually added all the transcripts using
     the add transcript member function
     
each of the objects have their own print functions for testing
     
compiled using:

g++ -Wall -Wextra main.cpp Transcript.cpp Semester.cpp Courses.cpp
