How to use make_fac_data to test your Assembly Line Simulator
------------------------------------------------------------------

We have provided you with two programs:

	make_fac_data  -- a script to generate sample data
	simp15         -- a reference program that produces correct output
	simu15         -- a reference program that produces correct output
	simt15         -- a reference program that produces correct output

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: These versions were replaced Nov 12 at 11:04 AM.  The previous
versions used the order:
      [a] move done packages to completed
      [b] move arriving packages to appropriate worker
      [c] workers do work

The CURRENT version uses this order:
      [a] workers do work
      [b] move done packages to completed
      [c] move arriving packages to appropriate worker

Make sure your version follows this sequence as the 'appropriate
worker' is determined by criteria that are affected by [b].

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERATING DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate sample data, type

	    ./make_fac_data 

	This will create randomly generated orders in the correct input format.

	To capture the data in a file, you can type:

	    ./make_fac_data  > data1

	You can use any filename for the capture file.  In fact, you can make
	several data sets for testing and use them over and over until your
	program work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
TESTING WITH SAMPLE DATA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
To test your program, do this:

	    ./a.out 1 3 < data1 > my_output

	then you can examine my_output to see if it is correct given the
	contents of data1. (you can of course call your output file any name you
	like.

	To obtain the correct output, do this:

	    simp15 1 3 < data1 > correct

	Now you can type:

	    diff my_output correct

	and see what the differences are.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
VARYING SAMPLE DATA RANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Varying the amount and range of data.  The default settings on the make_fac_data
script are that 

	  it will generate between 0 and 9 packages
	  it will each package will have between 0 and 9 units
	  the first package will arrive at a time between 0 and 9
	  the interval between one package and the next will be between 1 and 10 minutes

	BUT you can modify those settings with command line arguments:

	  e.g. ./make_fac_data -n 2000 -u 20 -i 1

	  will make up to 2000 packages, each with up to 20 units and have them
	  arrive every minute.

	you may use any combination of -n, -u, -i

AND	if you use the -z option to the program then the program might
	generate packages with 0 units.  The default is not to do so

AND	if you use the -s option to the program, then the program
	might generate packages that arrive at the same time.
	Handling this is NOT required, but with multiple assembly
	lines, it is nice to see how multiple tasks can be started
	at the same time.
