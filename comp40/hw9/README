	and using recursion and divide by ten, while storing the results
	on the stack and ignoring prints of zero unless in a single digit. 
Departures from Calling Convention:
        r4 was used in initialization and was not preserved. r4 was preserved
        in section 'text' procedures, aside from this I did not depart from the
        calling convention.

Overall:
        This was favorite assigment I really enjoyed this class. Thank you to
        all the faculty who set up this class and graded these long assignments.
        This was my favorite class at Tufts so far, even though at many times it
        was laughably overwhelming.
